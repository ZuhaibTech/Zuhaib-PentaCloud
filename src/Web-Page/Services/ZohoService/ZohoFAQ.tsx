      question: "What is the difference between Zoho CRM and Zoho One?",
      answer: "Zoho CRM is a single application focused on sales, marketing, and customer relationship management. Zoho One is a complete business operating suite containing 40+ integrated Zoho applications covering sales, marketing, finance, HR, project management, and more, all under one subscription. Zoho One is significantly better value for growing businesses that need multiple functions.",

      question: "How long does a Zoho CRM implementation take?",
      answer: "A standard Zoho CRM implementation for an SMB takes 2–4 weeks from kickoff to go-live. More complex implementations with custom modules, Deluge scripting, and multiple integrations take 5–8 weeks. A full Zoho One deployment across multiple departments takes 8–16 weeks depending on business complexity.",

      question: "Can you migrate our data from Salesforce to Zoho?",

We migrate all standard objects as well as custom objects, fields, attachments, and historical data, maintaining all relationships between records. We run a full test migration in a Zoho sandbox before touching production data.",
